# Design and structure changelog

Newest first. Every design or structure decision goes here.

## 2026-10-04 · Home page and site shell (Phase 3 pulled forward)

Aaron asked for a fuller browser preview, so the home page, case study page, and About page were built before Phase 2's MDX components and styleguide.

### Site components
- `Header`: name on the left, Work and About on the right, thin rule below. The current page gets an ink color and a terracotta underline.
- `Footer`: name, role, city, a contact placeholder, and the year, above a thin rule.
- `CaseCard`: a full width row between thin rules, with no box or shadow. It shows role and timeline as small labels, a large serif title, the summary, and a "Read the case study" link. Drafts show a terracotta "Draft" label. If a cover image exists, it sits beside the text from 48rem up.
- `PageLayout` wraps `BaseLayout` with the header, footer, and a skip link.

### Pages
- Home: label, headline placeholder, intro placeholder, then case study cards sorted by `order`.
- Case study (`/work/<slug>/`): the hero comes from frontmatter. Role, timeline, team, and tools sit in a facts row under a thin rule. The MDX body follows in the reading column, then previous and next links.
- About: placeholder text only.
- Case study URLs use `/work/` rather than `/case-studies/` because it is shorter and matches the Work nav item.

### Drafts in previews
- `SHOW_DRAFTS=true npm run build` keeps drafts in a production build. Use it only for private review previews. A plain `npm run build` still hides them.

### AthenaScribe draft
- `src/content/case-studies/athenascribe.mdx` holds only the facts Aaron gave: role, timeline, team, FigJam, and "Testing has not happened yet." Each one is marked `source TODO` in the frontmatter.
- Demo Day, ownership, and research scale numbers sit in an MDX comment until `<Stat>` and `<Contribution>` exist, so no unsourced number renders.

## 2026-10-04 · Phase 1: Scaffold

### Kit files drafted
- The kit files were missing from the repo, so Claude drafted `CLAUDE.md`, `design/DESIGN.md`, `src/styles/tokens.css`, `content/CONTENT.md`, and three commands in `.claude/commands/`. Each one is marked DRAFT. Aaron to review or replace with the originals.

### Stack
- Astro 7 with `@astrojs/mdx`, TypeScript (strict), plain CSS. No Tailwind.
- TypeScript pinned to 6 because `astro check` does not support 7 yet.

### Fonts
- Source Serif 4 (variable, with italic) for display and Inter (variable) for text, both self hosted through Fontsource. No third party font requests at runtime.

### Tokens
- Terracotta accent set to `#a84a22` so links pass WCAG AA (about 5:1) on the paper color. A lighter first pick, `#b4532a`, came in under 4.5:1.
- Dark mode uses warm charcoal paper and a lighter terracotta, `#e08a62`. It follows the system setting and can be forced with `data-theme` on `<html>`.
- `--gutter` is 16px on phones and 32px from 48rem up.

### Content collection
- `src/content.config.ts` defines `case-studies` with a zod schema matching `CONTENT.md` section 1.
- The glob pattern `**/[^_]*.mdx` skips files that start with `_`, so `_template.mdx` never renders.
- `getCaseStudies()` in `src/lib/case-studies.ts` hides `status: "draft"` in production builds, shows drafts in dev, and sorts by `order`.
- `status` defaults to `"draft"`, so nothing publishes by accident.
- Verified: a draft shows in dev and is hidden in the production build, and invalid frontmatter fails the build.

### Base styles
- `global.css` holds the reset, base element styles, and small layout helpers (`.container`, `.reading`, `.flow`, `.label`, `.visually-hidden`). All values come from tokens.
- `public/favicon.svg` uses the paper and accent hex values directly, because SVG favicons cannot read CSS variables.
